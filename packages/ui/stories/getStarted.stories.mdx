# Design system for Plan4Better

The Plan4Better design system is a set of guidelines and principles that should be followed when building new features or updating existing ones. This document outlines the core aspects of the design system, which include:

## Theming
Plan4Better uses a custom theming system, with color palettes, typography, and other styling variables defined in a central location. Developers should avoid hardcoding styles in their components and instead use the provided theming variables.

### Document for designers
The Figma design system for Plan4Better can be accessed via this  [here](https://www.figma.com/file/tu6pPILBRSUuy3Hbu8Lphk/Goat-3.0?type=design&node-id=10596-78889&t=SScnp0eh04aGYjQw-0).
Designers should use this system as a guide when creating new designs or updating existing ones.

## Codebase

The Plan4Better codebase is hosted on Github, and can be found [here](https://github.com/goat-community/goat).

### Components
The design system includes a library of reusable components, which are available for use across different parts of the application. Developers should make an effort to use these components wherever possible, rather than creating new ones from scratch.
