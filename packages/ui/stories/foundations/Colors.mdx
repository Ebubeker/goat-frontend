# Colors

The color system is built on a flexible palette that can be tailored to suit diverse themes and functionalities.
These colors have specific use cases including creating visually appealing designs, ensuring text is easily read,
and distinguishing user interface elements and surfaces. Implementing the color palette results in digital products
and interfaces having a consistent and recognizable aesthetic.
To maintain this consistency, clear guidelines on using the component library in both dark and light themes are provided.

### Focus

A focus color is a distinct color used in a design system to draw the user's attention to important elements such as buttons, links, or interactive components.
It is often a bright and vibrant hue that contrasts with the surrounding colors, allowing the user to easily identify where they should click or interact.
The use of a focus color improves accessibility and usability, particularly for individuals with visual impairments or those who may struggle to differentiate between interface elements.
In the context of a color palette system, Focus (Green) refers to a specific hue chosen as the primary focus color

### Dark and Light

Neutral colors, such as dark and light shades, are standard tones that are frequently utilized in typography,
backgrounds, outlines, and separators for many different interface components.
These colors are especially used for elements that cannot be clicked on and to show inactive states.
The two neutral colors have different tonal variations that allow for more subtle differences
in the display, which enhances the information hierarchy on the interface.
By utilizing both a dark and light color, it is possible to switch between two modes:
one where dark elements are displayed on light surfaces for a light mode, and another where
light elements are shown on dark surfaces by inverting the colors for a dark mode.

#### Colors palette

For functional applications, the color palette can be extended to include shade ranging from light to dark.
